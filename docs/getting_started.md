## Download and Install

To get started with Thorium, you first have to download and install it. A built version is available on teh [releases page](/en/releases) for any [donors](/en/donate). If you haven't donated, you can still install Thorium by building the code on your computer. Instructions for doing that are available on the [Github page](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium).

The controls have no dependencies and should start right up when you start the program.
