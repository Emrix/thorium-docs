title: Starting a Flight

Thorium differentiates Flights from simulators. A flight represents a single, self-contained instance of a simulator. Flights can be paused, resumed, and removed entirely.

Creating a flight is simple:

1. Click the green 'New Flight' button.

2. Change the name of the flight, if desired.

3. Pick a simulator.

4. Pick a station set for that simulator.

5. Pick a mission for that simulator or click 'Skip'.

6. Repeat 3 - 5 for any other simulators in the flight if you are doing a joint flight.

7. Click 'Start Flight' to initialize the flight and simulators.

## Assigning Clients to the Flight

![Assigning Clients](/docs/starting_flight_3.jpg)

To use the stations for a flight, you must assign clients to the flight and simulator. You can do this manually for each client by choosing the flight name from the first dropdown, the simulator from the second dropdown, and the station from the third dropdown.

**Note:** *Clients that are already assigned to a flight will not appear on the client list for a different flight. Remove it from the other flight before assigning it to a new flight.*

You can also configure the clients with a pre-defined set. This is done simply by clicking the name of the set from the list above. This conveniently re-names the simulator to be the same name as the set itself. 

Once assigned to a station, the client will start up. You can click 'Go to Core' to access the core for this flight.

If you selected multiple simulators, you'll be able to choose which simulator you want to access the core for.
